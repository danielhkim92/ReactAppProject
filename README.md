Welcome to my ReactApp. 

INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE

In the application, users can click on any button on the left side and a brief summary of that interview will pop up.   When users click on a type, there will be three videos that will load on the right side.  Users can view three videos that pertain to the personality type that was selected if they do not wish to read.   

IMPROVEMENTS

There are a lot of things I want to add. Due to time constraints, I didn't have the opportunity to complete the application as originally planned.  These are a few of the things that I would like to do and implement.
-I started a personality test but I couldn't figure out exactly how I wanted to render it into the application itself.  I originally wanted it out with the DisplayPage component but I felt that it wasn't very practical and hurt the user experience and practicality of the application as a whole.  After thinking about it a little bit more, I believe that making it into a modal would make the most sense. 
-I also wanted to add a comment board for each personality type but I had difficulty finding an API for the MBTI and in doing so, I tried to create my own API but constantly encountered issue after issue and I found an alternative by directly adding the personality type information direction into the state of the container application.  This alternative took more time and therefore I couldn't set up a socket server and set up the comment board.   

LESSONS IVE LEARNED

-I was told multiple times but I realized how important it was to carefully plan your components and state very thoroughly.  I encountered very small and annoying problems over and over while working on the components itself.  It's also fair to say that this was my first time creating my own application from scratch and I wasn't acquainted with going through certain states.  I really want to continue to work on this application and make it fully functional and have a more completed feel towards it.
-I need to learn how to scope on a smaller scale.  When encountering problems, I had difficulty really scoping the source of my problem because I kept thinking on a bigger scale.  As I continued to work on this project, I got better and better and troubleshooting my problems.
